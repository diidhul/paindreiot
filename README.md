# paindreiot

Paindre is an IoT device designed to assist healthcare professionals in conducting inspections on paralyzed patients. This device works by applying controlled pressure to the patient's skin, recording the data, and analyzing it using a system. The analyzed results are then displayed on a website page to serve as a guide for the patient's health progress.
